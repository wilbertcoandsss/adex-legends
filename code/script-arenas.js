Brought together by a mutual hatred for big Outland corporations, Arenas fighters covertly commandeer the place at night for fierce Arena matches under the smoggy skies. It’s a win-win for all groups involved, with an added element of danger for the participants and profits made on Hammond’s property right under their nose."

Early IMC research groups were surprised to find that a large population of local Leviathans gravitated toward the island, and designated Habitat 4 as an ethology base to study the creatures’ behavior. It’s been over a century since then, and while the IMC is gone, the gentle giants they studied here remain."

It hasn't seen any human activity for the majority of its operation, but after its spacious platforms caught the eyes of the Arenas organizers, it began doing double-duty as an industrial mining operation and a site for chaotic combat."
