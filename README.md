ðŸ’» Adex Legends â€” My Own Day One Project

A Duplicated-Inspired by Apex Legends Website project I worked on as a Project Assignment on my Second Semester Human and Computer Interaction Courses. 

It remarks as my first-project that I have as CS student back when I am still in my Freshman Year. 

Built using just simple HTML, CSS, and JS-based website.
